# Category Theory + NLP (Natural Language Processing)


List of papers and other resources at the intersection of Category Theory and NLP.

For CT + ML, there's another great resource [here](https://github.com/bgavran/Category_Theory_Machine_Learning).

Please feel free to PR or email me if you have anything to add - there's much more to put in, will build as I have the time.

This will also be in a public Roam graph when they add more DBs/user.
